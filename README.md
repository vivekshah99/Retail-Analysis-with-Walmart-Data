# Retail-Analysis-with-Walmart-Data

# Introduction

In today’s world, where the competition is cut-throat and making business decisions is equally
challenging, the need to accurately make predictions is of now of more importance than ever.
Forecasting is being done across a large number of domains, like sports, weather etc due to the
advantageous nature of its prediction. When organizations like Walmart, one of the leading
retail stores in the US, who possesses a large amount of capital and also a significantly large
number of customers, gaining even a slight upper hand could have a huge amount of impact on
the fortunes of the company.

In our project we are working towards predicting the future sales of this retail giant. Sales
forecasting makes use of trends identified from historical data to predict future sales, thus
enabling educated decisions including assigning or redirecting current inventory, or effectively
managing the future production. With the help of this project, we would like to predict the sales
and demand as accurately as possible. Using this data (Walmart Store Sales) obtained from
Kaggle platform, we aim to identify the stores which have a higher growth rate per quarter and
we also wanted to analyse how certain external factors like for e.g. ‘holidays’, ‘temperature’,
‘CPI’ affect the sales figures of Walmart, either in a positive way or a negative way.

The dataset comprises of data that has been collected from 2010-2012. It contains sales data of
45 Walmart stores. Walmart recently outlined in their research report that they face certain
challenges like running out of or low on certain stock items due to inaccurate demand
forecasting by their machine learning algorithms. Thus, with the help of this project, we aim to
provide Walmart with a solution that accurately predicts the impact that certain internal and
external factors like CPI (Consumer Price Index), unemployment rate, temperature, holidays
as well as Fuel prices can have on their sales in the future. These external factors help us make
a more detailed analysis.

# Conclusion

This project gives us a hands-on experience on how to use big data for detailed analyses. With
the help of this project, we have successfully forecasted the sales figures for Walmart Inc. and
also how external factors like CPI, Unemployment, Fuel Price etc. have an impact on the
weekly sales figures for the retail giant. This project also dealt with the implementation of
several machine learning models like linear regression model, random forest, ARIMA model
etc. to accurately predict the dependency on how external factors impact weekly sales of
Walmart and also forecast the sales for upcoming year.

Through this project, we have also successfully created a Tableau dashboard using which the
user can check several attributes of the data set, especially how the geographical location of
the stores is impacting the sales.

With this project, we provide Walmart with a thorough analysis on how factors like fuel price
etc. affect their sales numbers and how they can increase their figures. We also analyze and
present how the sales figures are higher for holidays and how the sales are impacted due to the
weather, thus enabling them to take better inventory related decisions. Based on our results, we
can conclude that Unemployment and CPI are two of the most important predictors with the
strongest correlation with weekly sales and these two variables have the largest impact on the
weekly sales figures of Walmart.
